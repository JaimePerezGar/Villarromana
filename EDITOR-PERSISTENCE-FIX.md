# Editor Content Persistence Fix

## Overview
This document explains the fixes implemented to resolve the content persistence issue and improve the admin interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. Content Persistence Fix
**Issue**: Changes made in the editor were not persisting after page refresh.

**Root Cause**: Content was only loaded when the editor was initialized (i.e., when logged in as admin). Regular visitors didn't see the saved changes.

**Solution**: Created a new `content-loader.js` script that:
- Loads saved content on every page load for all visitors
- Runs before the editor script
- Applies saved content from JSON files to the page elements
- Works independently of the editor login state

**Files Modified/Created**:
- Created: `/js/content-loader.js`
- Modified: All HTML pages to include the content loader script

### 2. Admin Button Improvements
**Changes Made**:
- Reduced admin button to just a lock icon (🔐)
- Made it circular with a 40px diameter
- Added hover effects (scale and color change)
- Added tooltip "Admin Login"

### 3. Simple Captcha Implementation
**Added Security Features**:
- Simple math captcha (addition of two random numbers 1-10)
- Captcha regenerates on each failed attempt
- Prevents automated login attempts
- User-friendly with clear instructions

## How Content Persistence Works

1. **Editor saves content** → PHP backend stores in `/content/{page}.json`
2. **On page load** → `content-loader.js` fetches saved content
3. **Content applied** → Saved changes are applied to matching elements
4. **Editor agnostic** → Works whether editor is loaded or not

## Testing Instructions

### Method 1: Using Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/skllz/Documents/Claude/Villaromana/villarromana-web

# Start PHP server with Docker
./scripts/start-php-editor.sh

# Access the site at http://localhost:8080
```

### Method 2: Using Built-in PHP Server
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/skllz/Documents/Claude/Villaromana/villarromana-web

# Start PHP server
php -S localhost:8000

# Access the site at http://localhost:8000
```

### Method 3: Test Page
1. Open `test-persistence.html` in your browser
2. Run the tests in order:
   - Test PHP Backend
   - Test Load Content
   - Test Save Content
3. Edit the test content using the editor
4. Save changes
5. Refresh the page to verify persistence

## Login Process

1. Click the small lock icon (🔐) in the top-right corner
2. Enter credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `metadrop2024`
3. Solve the math captcha
4. Click Login

## Verifying Persistence

1. **Login** as admin
2. **Edit** any text or image on the page
3. **Save** changes using the toolbar
4. **Logout** or close the browser
5. **Refresh** the page
6. **Verify** that your changes are still visible

## File Structure

```
/content/
├── index.json          # Saved content for homepage
├── en_index.json       # Saved content for English homepage
├── galeria.json        # Saved content for gallery page
└── backups/            # Automatic backups with timestamps

/js/
├── content-loader.js   # Loads saved content for all visitors
├── editor.js           # Admin editor functionality
└── main.js             # Site functionality

/php/
├── config.php          # Configuration and helpers
├── load-content.php    # Loads saved content
├── save-content.php    # Saves content changes
└── upload-image.php    # Handles image uploads
```

## Troubleshooting

### Content Not Persisting
1. Check PHP is running: `http://localhost:8080/php/test.php`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify `/content/` directory is writable
4. Check if JSON files are being created in `/content/`

### Can't Login
1. Verify credentials (case-sensitive)
2. Ensure captcha answer is correct
3. Clear browser cache/cookies
4. Check browser console for errors

### Editor Not Loading
1. Ensure JavaScript is enabled
2. Check for script loading errors
3. Verify all script files are accessible
4. Try a different browser

## Security Notes

- Captcha prevents automated login attempts
- Credentials are hardcoded (change in production)
- Content files are JSON (not executable)
- Image uploads are restricted by type and size
- Directory traversal is prevented

## Future Improvements

1. Database storage instead of JSON files
2. User management system
3. Version control for content changes
4. More sophisticated captcha options
5. Content approval workflow
